# E-Commerce Back-End Project

## DESCRIPTION
Build the back end for an e-commerce site. 
You’ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

### GETTING STARTED
You’ll need to use the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect your Express.js API to a MySQL database.
The dotenv package will use environment variables to store sensitive data, like your MySQL username, password, and database name.

### DATABASE MODELS
Your database should contain the following four models: Category, Product, Tag, ProductTag

### SEED THE DATABASE
After creating the models and routes, run npm run seed to seed data to your database so that you can test your routes.

### SYNC SEQUELIZE TO DATABASE ON SERVER START
Create the code needed in server.js to sync the Sequelize models to the MySQL database on server start.
